# Simulation of RC and RL Circuit Response
\nThis project simulates the response of RC and RL circuits using Python or MATLAB.
\n## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib`
2. Run RC simulation: `python rc_simulation.py`
3. Run RL simulation: `python rl_simulation.py`

# Simulation-of-RC-RL-Circuit-Response-using-MATLAB-Problem-Statement

Simulation of RC/RL Circuit Response using MATLAB Problem Statement: Team 2 Develop a script that simulates the transient response of an RC (Resistor-Capacitor) or RL (Resistor-Inductor) circuit. The tool should plot the voltage/current over time based on user-input values.
