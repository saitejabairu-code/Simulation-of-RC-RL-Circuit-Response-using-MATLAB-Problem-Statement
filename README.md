# Simulation-of-RC-RL-Circuit-Response-using-Python-or-MATLAB-Problem-Statement

Simulation of RC/RL Circuit Response using Python or MATLAB Problem Statement: Team 2 Develop a script that simulates the transient response of an RC (Resistor-Capacitor) or RL (Resistor-Inductor) circuit. The tool should plot the voltage/current over time based on user-input values.
